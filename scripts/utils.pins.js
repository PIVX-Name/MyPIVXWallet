 *
 * Every field of the leaf preimage is checked to an exact shape before it is hashed.

 * rigid is to pin the lengths instead: `price` and `nonce` are 8 bytes each,
 * `owner_pubkey` is exactly 32, and a target address is exactly one length for the
 * network. With all of those fixed, the domain's length is fixed too, and no byte can
 * move from one field into its neighbour while still describing a well formed response.
 *
 * The proof is variable depth: `proof_depth` levels of siblings, with a terminal
 * saying what sits at the bottom. A resolve always answers with `Occupied` - the
 * name's own leaf - because the indexer returns "Domain not found" rather than an
 * absence proof, so `Vacant` and `Blocked` are rejected here as malformed.
